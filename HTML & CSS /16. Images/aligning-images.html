        The <b>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</b>is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is
        derived from the Welsh words cor and ci (which is mutated to gi), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively.</p>

        Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical
        differences between the two different breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger,
        both in weight and height. Their tails are of different shapes, and docking was previously performed on corgis
        before the practice was largely banned.</p>
