    <h1>Reverse proxy</h1>
    <p>
        In computer networks, a <b>reverse proxy</b> is the application that sits in front of back-end applications and
        forwards client (e.g. browser) requests to those applications. Reverse proxies help increase scalability,
        performance, resilience and security. The resources returned to the client appear as if they originated from the
        web server itself.
