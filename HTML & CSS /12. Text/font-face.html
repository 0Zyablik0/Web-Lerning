    <h1>Standard Model</h1>
    <p class="credentials">by Artem Kryukov</p>
    <p class="intro">
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics is the theory
        describing three of the four known fundamental forces
        (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions - excluding gravity) in the universe and classifying all known
        elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the
        work of many scientists worldwide, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon
        experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.

    <h2>Historical background</h2>
    <p>
        In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills extended the concept of gauge theory for abelian groups, e.g. quantum
        electrodynamics, to nonabelian groups to provide an explanation for strong interactions. In 1957,
        Chien-Shiung Wu demonstrated parity was not conserved in the weak interaction. In 1961, Sheldon Glashow
        combined the electromagnetic and weak interactions. In 1967 Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam
        incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's electroweak interaction, giving it its modern form.
