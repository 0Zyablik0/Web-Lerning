    <h2>Ancient astronomy</h2>
    <p>
        Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating back before 3000 BCE, such as the
        Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic
        awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were
        often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and
        lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found
        to traverse great circles across the sky, which could not explain the positions of the planets.
