    <h1>String theory</h1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In the 20th century, two theoretical frameworks emerged for formulating the laws of physics. The first is
            Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, a theory that explains the force of gravity and the
            structure of spacetime at the macro-level. The other is quantum mechanics, a completely different
            formulation, which uses known probability principles to describe physical phenomena at the micro-level. By
            the late 1970s, these two frameworks had proven to be sufficient to explain most of the observed features of
            the universe, from elementary particles to atoms to the evolution of stars and the universe as a whole.

        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>
            The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are
            extended in space and time, is known as quantum field theory. In particle physics, quantum field theories
            form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the
            fundamental fields.

        <h3>Extra dimensions</h3>
        <p>
            In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions (3D) of space: height, width and length. Einstein's
            general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general
            relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a
            four-dimensional (4D) spacetime. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of
            the geometry of spacetime.
