    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species
        endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant
        panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
