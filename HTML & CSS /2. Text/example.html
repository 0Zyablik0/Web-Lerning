    <h1>The story of the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly has been staring out of her window for about one hour now. On her desk, lying between the
        copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work
        had appeared in , was the well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's
        favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt
        she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under the poster with Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
        that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q> . Although many considered her pioneering
        work, unraveling the secretes of the llama <abbr title="Dioxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding
        achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
